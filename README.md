## Lib Tile 3D
LT3D is a voxel rendering engine that uses OpenCL based raytracing, it also has the ability to combine classical OpenGL rendering with the raytraced image.

#### Build
LT3D uses CMake, but for ease-of-use a helper script is available to compile and run examples:
* Use `python3 build.py --run` to run the default example - `world`
* Use `python3 build.py --list` to list avaible example programs
* Use `python3 build.py --help` for aditional info
